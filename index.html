        <p>
          The built-in pdf viewer uses the proprietary Adobe PDF API. I could do
          this with <code>pdf.js</code> but it's slow, or just html/css but this does not
          work for mobile browsers and perhaps other operating systems. I don't
          know what kind of awful telemetry Adobe collects through this, but I
          don't <i>care for</i> nor have the time to use this telemetry
          available for me as the API user.
